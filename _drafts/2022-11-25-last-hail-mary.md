I recently came across the following video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2CaEW1QRkY).

When the [first bug on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1) was originally filed in 2004, the marketshare of Linux in the desktop space was around 3.1%. So even after 18 years, there has not been even a dent in the total domination of the market by Windows and MacOS, no matter how many missteps are taken by them.

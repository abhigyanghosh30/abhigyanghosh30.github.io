> Hi! My name is Abhigyan. I am starting my own blog where I hope to capture things I find interesting as well as things that annoy me on a day to day basis. I hope to be able to post regularly but we shall see.

> What can you expect to find here? Well not much that might be of interest to you. It is a catarthic place where I get to vent. It is my site, so no I donot care what you think but if you still have some feedback, you can mail me on [ihavetoomuchtime@gmail.com](mailto:ihavetoomuchtime@gmail.com)

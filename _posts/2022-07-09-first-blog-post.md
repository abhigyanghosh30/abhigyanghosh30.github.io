Hi! My name is Abhigyan. I am starting my own blog where I hope to capture things I find interesting as well as things that annoy me on a day to day basis. I hope to be able to post regularly but we shall see.

What can you expect to find here? Well not much that might be of interest to you. It is a catarthic place where I get to vent. However given my usual trains of thought, you could expect opinions on topics of cars and tech

Since it is my first attempt at a blog, I would like your feedback on the stuff I write. You can find my contact details [here]({{site.baseurl}}/contact)
